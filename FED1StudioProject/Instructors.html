                    <h3>Aaron Costa</h3>
                    <p>
                        Looks can be deceiving when it comes Aaron Costa, but two things you'll never forget are that he's modest and playful. Of course he's also incorruptible, patient and captivating, but these are in a way balance by being self-indulgent as well.
                        His modesty though, this is what he's most well-liked for. Friends frequently count on this and his forgiving nature when they're feeling down.

                        Nobody's perfect of course and Aaron has plenty of lesser desired aspects too. His pompous nature and narrow-mindedness pose plenty of problems, both personally and for others.
                        Fortunately his playfulness assures this isn't the case very often.

                    <h3>Kason Kresswell</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's a lot to say about Kason Kresswell, but above else know that he's flexible and objective. Of course he's also cheerful, dynamic and freethinking, but those are often overshadowed by tendencies of being childish as well.
                        His flexibility though, this is what he's kind of cherished for. Friends usually count on this and his responsibility in times of need.

                        Nobody's perfect of course and Kason has a share of darker sides to deal with too. His neglectful nature and ignorance don't make for the greatest company, both personally and for others.
                        Fortunately his objectivity is there to relift spirits when needed.

                    <h3>Jonny Herbert</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many things can be said of Jonny Herbert, but if there's anything you should know it's that he's protective and brilliant. Of course he's also resourceful, warm and enthusiastic, but in smaller doses and they're often spoiled by habits of being extreme as well.
                        His protective nature though, this is what he's so well-liked for. Friends frequently count on this and his daring nature whenever they need assistance or help.
