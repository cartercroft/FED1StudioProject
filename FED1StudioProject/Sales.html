                    <h3>Alice Massey</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's more than meets the eye in the case of Alice Massey, but the biggest two things to know are that she's forgiving and determined. Of course she's also independent, intuitive and faithful, but they're far less prominent, especially compared to impulses of being narcissistic as well.
                        Her forgiving nature though, this is what she's often admired for. There are many times when friends count on this and her brilliance especially when they need comforting or support.

                    <h3>Sofija Dyer</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot can be assumed when you first see Sofija Dyer, but perhaps most important is that she's considerate and elegant. Of course she's also focused, sweet and innovative, but these are in a way balance by being dishonest as well.
                        Her considerate nature though, this is what she's so well-liked for. Friends frequently count on this and her active nature when they're in need of support.

                    <h3>Haroon Sharpe</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's more than meets the eye in the case of Haroon Sharpe, but if there's anything you should know it's that he's precise and sociable. Of course he's also anticipative, insightful and earnest, but they're less prominent and often intertwined with being shallow as well.
                        His precision though, this is what he's so well-liked for. People regularly count on this and his flexibility in times of need.
