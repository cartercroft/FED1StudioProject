                    <h3>Raveena Hansen</h3>
                    <p>
                        Few know the true Raveena Hansen, but two things you'll never forget are that she's empathetic and athletic. Of course she's also honorable, witty and warm, but they're often slightly tainted by a mindset of being pretentious as well.
                        Her empathy though, this is what she's kind of cherished for. Friends usually count on this and her reliability whenever they need assistance or help.

                    <h3>Nathan Hart</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot can be assumed when you first see Nathan Hart, but at the very least he's spontaneous and imaginative. Of course he's also caring, daring and contemplative, but in a way they're lesser traits and tained by behaviors of being demanding as well.
                        His spontaneity though, this is what he's pretty much known for. People regularly count on this and his capabilities especially when they need comforting or support.

                    <h3>Devin Pittman</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot can be said of Devin Pittman, but the two traits most people enjoy the most are that she's insightful and lovable. Of course she's also practical, brilliant and trusting, but they're often slightly tainted by a mindset of being angry as well.
                        Her insight though, this is what she's often admired for. On many occasions people will count on this and her discretion when they're feeling down.
